# Horiseon - Code Refactoring



## The Challenge

This week, your Challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's Challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

## What I Did

For this challenge, I edited the given HTML and CSS files swapping out non-semantic elements for semantic ones. I consolidated selectors in the CSS file so that there was no repetition of code and made sure that everything was in a logical order.

Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span

Examples of semantic elements: header and section.

## What I Learned

I learned how important it is to use semantic elements in HTML to improve accessibility for the user and readability for the developer.
